/**
 * SECURITY NOTICE:
 *
 * This class uses a 30-byte truncation of addresses for storage pointer generation.
 * While this may appear to introduce collision risks, it is secure within the OP_NET
 * protocol context because:
 *
 * 1. All addresses in OP_NET are tweaked public keys (32-byte elliptic curve points)
 *
 * 2. Tweaked public keys are uniformly distributed across the secp256k1 curve space
 *
 * 3. Finding two public keys with identical 30-byte prefixes (240 bits) requires
 *    approximately 2^120 operations due to the birthday paradox
 *
 * 4. The probability of accidentally generating colliding addresses through normal
 *    key generation is cryptographically negligible
 *
 * The truncation from 32 to 30 bytes is a space optimization that does not
 * meaningfully impact security given the uniform distribution of elliptic curve points.
